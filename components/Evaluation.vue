    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      You are required to attend all class meetings and submit all weekly
      assignments and a final project.
    </p>
    <p>Grading (pass/fail) will be based on a combination of factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Attendance, participation in class discussion, and engagement in other
        students' projects (40%)
      </li>
      <li>Assignments (40%)</li>
      <li>Final Project (20%)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please see ITP's statement on Pass/Fail which states that a "Pass" is
      equivalent to an "A" or a "B" while anything less would be considered a
      "Fail".
    </p>
    <p>
      Attendance is mandatory. Please inform your teacher via email if you are
      going to miss a class. Two unexcused absences is cause for failing the
      class. (An unexcused lateness of 10 minutes or more is equivalent to 1/2
      an absence.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This class will be participatory, you are expected to participate in
      discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and
      participate with their projects. This (along with attendance) is 40% of
      your grade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Class will culminate with final projects. You are expected to push your
      abilities to produce something that utilizes what you have learned in the
      class that is useful in some manner to yourself or the world. This will
      comprise 20% of your grade.
